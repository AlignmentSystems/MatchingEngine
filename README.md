# MatchingEngine
A toy implementation of a matching engine. Don't use this in the real world, it's a toy!

The purpose here was to simply show that for a **specific** use-case of 
(a) Low volume
(b) Unregulated to no need to conform with IOSCO pFMI 

Then a toy can do the heavy lifting and there is no need to pay the big vendor tax for a matching engine.

**If you have arrived here thinking this is a fully-featured matching engine ready for prime-time, please leave now.**  

This is not and will **never** be so!
